Project Title

Social Media Post Performance Prediction System

Project Overview

The Social Media Post Performance Prediction System is a machine learning–based project designed to predict the future performance of social media posts on platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

Using historical post data, the system analyzes user behavior, posting patterns, and engagement metrics to estimate how a new post is likely to perform before it is published. The predicted outputs include expected likes, engagement level, and follower growth, helping users optimize their content strategy.

Problem Statement

Content creators and businesses often struggle to understand when, what, and how to post to achieve maximum engagement on social media platforms. Posting without data-driven insights can lead to inconsistent growth and low engagement.

This project addresses the problem by answering:

“Based on my past social media performance, how will my next post perform?”

Objectives

Analyze historical social media post data

Identify patterns affecting engagement and growth

Predict future post performance using machine learning

Help users improve posting strategy and timing

Provide insights for data-driven decision making

Methodology

Data Collection
Historical post data is collected, including posting time, content type, captions, hashtags, likes, comments, and followers.

Data Preprocessing
Missing values are handled, categorical data is encoded, and irrelevant features are removed.

Feature Engineering
Raw data is converted into meaningful numerical features suitable for machine learning models.

Model Training
Regression-based machine learning models are trained using past data.

Prediction & Evaluation
The trained model predicts the performance of future posts, and accuracy is evaluated using test data.
